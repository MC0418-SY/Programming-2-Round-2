## **Dot Notation vs. Arrow Notation**
- The dot operator is used to access members of a structure or union directly through its variable. This means that when you have a structure variable (not a pointer), you use the dot operator to access its members.​
- The arrow operator is used to access members of a structure or union through a pointer. When you have a pointer to a structure, you use the arrow operator to access its members. Internally, ptr->member is equivalent to (*ptr).member.​

---IMPORTANT INFO---<br>
pList.(*(list+1)).x = 5;

padding - space or layer between data in the memory

Dynamic vs. Static Array 
- A static array is fixed i.e. unchangeable. In a dynamic array, you can change or resize the array.
- Malloc is used if we want to make it dynamic.
- A static array is in the stack memory and a dynamic array is in the heap memory.
- A dynamic array, if not freed, it will stay in the memory and will only disappear if you restart your computer.
